### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Henrique.

If I say my dream as a kid was to become a software developer I would be lying. Until I gave it a try and then realized that there is more than one right answer in coding, and problem-solving is a determinant skill, I have been coding every day.

Now, I completed a Software Developer Bootcamp, which I finished 6 months before the deadline. Discipline and consistency are two of the skills that help me learn how to code and get 1% better every day.
